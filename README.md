# About this project

This project is based on my daily work, because the GitLab markdown system is always show image at full size, sometime it’s too big to see the below content.

```markdown
![image](/uploads/89171f6fbe586220cad8316793754862/image.png)
```

```html
<img src="/uploads/89171f6fbe586220cad8316793754862/image.png" width="300" />
```

This project is a **Chrome plugin**, which helps us right-click and it’ll replace the current markdown with HTML and size prop

We’ll use this regex to separate the image path and replace it with HTML content
